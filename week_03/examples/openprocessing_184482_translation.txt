setup program.
  create a window size 500 width, 500 height
  draw smoothly
  set frameRate to 10 fps
end setup

start draw loop
  clear the background to teal
  for each integer c from 0 to 599, loop:
    for each integer i from 0 to 599, loop:
      set stroke color to yellow
      set fill color to red = i, green = 50, and blue = c
      draw a circle at position c,y with a diameter of 10
      add assign 25 to i
    end for
    add assign 25 to c
  end for

  for each integer l from 0 to 499, loop:
    create local float variable x with value btwn 0 & 300
    create local float variable y with value btwn 0 & 300
    set stroke weight to random value btwn 1 & 3
    set stroke color to yellow
    draw a yellow line, from point l,x to l,y
    add assign 5 to l
  end for

  for each integer w from 500 to 1, loop:
    set stroke color to tan
    set stroke weight to random value btwn 1 & 3
    draw tan line from 250,-50 to w,500
    subtract assign 10
  end for
